🔍 Kioptrix VM3 Vulnerability Assessment Report

📝 Executive Summary

The security assessment of the Kioptrix machine has brought several vulnerabilities to light. These findings reveal potential risks that could lead to unauthorised access and compromise of sensitive information. Below is an outline of the key discoveries and their impact:

🔒 Risk Levels

2 Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities

4 Low-Risk Vulnerabilities

🚨 Key Findings

1️⃣ SQL Injection Vulnerability 📊

The web application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Exploiting this, the penetration tester gained initial access to the host, indicating the need for stronger input validation on the website's database queries.

2️⃣ Insecure Credential Storage 🔑

Sensitive information such as database passwords was found in clear text on the server, posing a direct security risk. This highlights the importance of securely managing sensitive credentials.

3️⃣ Remote Access Weakness 🌐

Exploiting weaknesses in the SSH port configuration, the tester obtained user credentials, which allowed access to a user account on the system. From there, privilege escalation techniques enabled the tester to gain root access to the server.

✅ Recommendations

To enhance the security of the Kioptrix machine, it’s recommended to:

1️⃣ Update web application software and configurations to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

2️⃣ Secure sensitive information by enforcing encryption and proper storage practices.

3️⃣ Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorised remote access and minimise the risk of privilege escalation.
