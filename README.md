🔍 About This Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity repository! Here, you’ll find detailed reports on 🔒 security assessments, 🚨 incident response investigations, and 💻 exploit development across various virtual environments designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities.

🧑‍💻 Introduction

As a cybersecurity specialist and penetration tester, I conduct rigorous security assessments and investigations on virtual machines. These reports cover the methodologies, findings, and remediation strategies I employ to:

 📌 Identify vulnerabilities

 📌 Exploit potential weaknesses

 📌 Analyse post-exploitation effects on targeted systems.

📜 Background

Each report explores different security scenarios:

🛠️ Vulnerability assessments in virtual environments

🐛 Trojan-based exploit development and deployment

Together, these reports offer a practical look into real-world attack vectors and effective defence techniques, serving as a valuable resource for those aiming to enhance their penetration testing and incident response skills.

🗂️ Usage

All reports are organised by focus area:

 📌 Vulnerability Assessments

 📌 Incident Responses

 📌 Exploit Development

Each report is saved in PDF format, featuring:

📋 Introductions to test environments

🧰 Methodologies and tools used

📸 Screenshots and technical insights

🤝 Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! 🚀 If you’ve conducted similar assessments or developed exploits in secure environments, feel free to submit a pull request with your report! Let’s grow this resource together.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these resources valuable!
